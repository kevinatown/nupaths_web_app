## HTML
- HTML Structure
- Semantic HTML
  + **Semantic HTML Tags** have extra context to them. This extra context helps the developer and the browser know more about **PURPOSE** the element is used.
  + Example of semantic elements:
    * `article` - just like a magazine/newspaper/blog artilce, should contain information that stands alone by itself (like you can send a newspaper or magazine article to someone, you shouldnt have to provide any extra infomation). `div` with(or without) `p` tags are a non-semantic version of the `article` tag
    * `section` - similar to article however, it does not need to live on it's own. (`article`'s can have chapters :).
    * `strong` the semantic way to explain that something should be conveyed **stongly**. The non-semantic version will be `b`, which only adds the bold style to the content. `strong` also conveys to the developer and browser (the end user's access) that the content is not just visualy bold but also of importance.
    * `em` the semantic way to explain that something should be conveyed _empatically_. The non-semantic version will be `i`, which only adds the bold style to the content. `em` also conveys to the developer and browser (the end user's access) that the content is not just visualy italicised but also should be emphasized.
    * `header` the header of the page (see below for the page structure)
    * `footer` the footer of the page (see below for the page structure)
    * `main` the main content of the page (see below for the page structure)
